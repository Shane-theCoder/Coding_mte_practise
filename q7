The Sliding Window Technique is an algorithmic approach used to efficiently solve problems involving arrays or strings by maintaining a "window" that slides over the data to process subarrays or substrings optimally. It helps reduce time complexity from O(nÂ²) (brute force) to O(n) (optimized).

Applications in String Problems
The sliding window technique is widely used in string manipulation problems, such as:
1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
2. Minimum Window Substring
3. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
4. Permutation in String (Anagram Check)
