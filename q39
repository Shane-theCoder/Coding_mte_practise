Subsets -> A subset is a selection of elements from a set, where order does not matter, and elements are not repeated.
           For a set with n elements, the total number of subsets is 2^n.
Example:
Let’s the set {1, 2, 3}

The subsets are: {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}
Notice that: {1, 2} is the same as {2, 1} (order doesn’t matter).

The total is 2^3 = 8 subsets.

Permutations -> A permutation is an arrangement of elements where order does matter.
                For a set of n unique elements:
                  The number of all possible permutations (with all elements used) is n! (n factorial).
                  If choosing r elements out of n, the number of r-length permutations is nPr = n!.
Example:
Using the same set {1, 2, 3}
The permutations of all 3 elements are: {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}
